## Introduction
To be fair, maths is an extrememly difficult subject to even understand, and therefore certainly requires some talents. Nevertheless, this is less true in a well established curriculum, which only meant to provide a foundational understanding of maths.

I have been teaching maths for three years, and my point is clear: **everyone has the ability to pass maths exams, given that you have the correct attitude towards it**. I shall now justify this view shortly (not rigorously) and share some examples that could inspire you (or your children) how to study maths.

## A Short Argument
It must be agreed that some forms of mathematical intuition are naturally implanted in the human brain. You know how to count candies, or to identify the shape of a football without being taught. It was only when you first entered the school that you learned about the names for numbers and geometric shapes, but the concepts were already well understood.

I know this won't convince you, so let's consider another example: trigonometric functions. This topic is perhaps the scariest among others in form 2 maths, since it introduces a weird notation that students never see before. But its idea is simple:

![Blog 1 - Triangle](/blog_images/blog_1/triangle.png)

When the side lengths $a$ and $b$ of the triangle changes, the angle $\theta$ they form changes as well. Notice that the value of $\theta$ does **not** depend on the exact lengths, but the relative lengths of $a$ and $b$ (i.e. a 3-4-5 triangle will have exactly the same angle as 6-8-10 triangle). Therefore, we know that $\theta$ must hold some relationship to the **ratio** of $a$ and $b$. This motivates as to define:

$$
    \frac{a}{b} = \tan \theta
$$

The intuition behind this scary equation is thus surprising simple.

Once you have gripped the concepts and ideas, there's nothing to stop you from applying them. This mastery means the real work now shifts to deliberate practice, where you refine your technique. Through repetition, these applications will become second nature.

## Fight Against Fear
The most common excuses that I hear from others are as follows:

- Maths is just too **hard**; I just can't do it
- There are too many formulas and methods to **rememeber**
- Maths is **useless**

Let's talk about them one by one. 

First, we have the "maths is hard" excue. As I mentioned, this statement is actually correct when referring to the work of mathematicians, who primarily invent new theorems and solve centuries-old problems. However, this is absolutely not true when you are a foundational maths learner. The curriculum has been well-developed over many years, and there's no reason why those who designed it would expect you to do advanced math.

A general method to solve challenging problems is to consider a simpler version of them and look for the pattern. For example, most students could solve the following factorization problem:

$$
    \begin{align*}
        ak - bk \\
        = k(a - b)
    \end{align*}
$$

Then they get stuck at:

$$
    a(1-x) - b(1-x) \\
$$

But these problems are really the same; the factor with $k$  has simply been replaced by $(1-x)$. If you can break down a problem like this, you will be able to solve it in seconds.

Secondly, we have the "too many to remember" excuse. This doesn't make much sense either. You will not find any subject that doesn't require you to memorize some information. Not to mention the fact that maths is already one of the few subjects that involves **very little** memorization. Formulas and properties are all derived and deduced from a set of more basic facts. It is completely possible to deduce the formulas on your own, even during exams. Take the "perfect square" formula for example, for example; it can be derived using the distributive law:

$$
    \begin{align*}
        (a + b)^2 \\
        &= (a + b)(a + b) \\
        &= a(a + b) + b (a + b) \\
        &= a^2 + ab + ab + b^2 \\
        &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2
    \end{align*}
$$

The formulas and methods are taught precisely because they simplify computation and serve as a foundation for more profound concepts.

Lastly, we have the "maths is useless" excuse. Frankly, for this view, I don't even want to debunk it; it reveals a sense of ignorance of the world around them. Whether you love math or not, you must recognize that it has profound applications in almost all fields. Please don't let this statement be your excuse.

## Conclusion
Despite being a short article, I hope the message is conveyed well: "you definitely have the ability to deal with your exam, don't let fear beats you down".
